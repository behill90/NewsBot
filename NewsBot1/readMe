This is a first pass attempt to create a bot that will pull in news from various security
related feeds and summarize the articles that are relevant to our tech stack, summarize them
using Anthropic AI and post them into a slack channel.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install requirements
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Create a .env file and add the following variables
    ```bash
    slack_bot_token=FOUND IN 1 PASSWORD
    slack_channel=sec-news
    anthropic_api_key=FOUND IN 1 PASSWORD
    ```
   3. Run the debug script to verify everything is working
    ```bash
    python debug.py
    ```
   4. Run the main script to collect and summarize the articles
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

Please feel free to iterate and improve on this
